        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who is fascinated by the coding world. My favorite thing about web design is that it is the perfect balance of left and right brain skills. My skillset has always leaned more towards creativity, but I also love learning about math, science, and technology.</p>
        <p>I am the Digital Marketing Coordinator for a utility company. My primary role is web and graphic design.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a nerd at heart. I have a passion for pop culture and entertainment. I love reading and watching anime, tv shows, and movies. I'm a die-hard Game of Thrones and Walking Dead fan.</p>
        <p>I love to analyze and talk about the in-depth storylines with regards to the character development, metaphorical meanings, and valuable life lessons.</p>
        <p>I also love fall weather, doing yoga, and vacationing in the mountains.</p>
